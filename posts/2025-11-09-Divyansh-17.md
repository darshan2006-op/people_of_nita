I loved mathematics but had no concrete goal in 10th grade.

A tuition teacher introduced me to engineering; COVID disrupted my 12th year, and I began preparing for JEE via online programs. After an underprepared Mains attempt (84 percentile), I decided to drop a year, joined various coaching efforts, and faced setbacks—answer key issues and time-management problems—yet still improved my scores and eventually got Mathematics and Computing at NIT Agartala.

## The Beginning: Finding Direction

Moving 2,800 km from Najibabad to Agartala and living away from my joint family for the first time was overwhelming. The first year passed quickly as I adjusted to hostel life and a new course structure (BSMS).

## The Turning Point: WeCan

During the technical fest Aayam, I discovered many clubs, but WeCan—teaching underprivileged children—became transformative. I joined as a volunteer, helped restart the program when leadership left, and organized WeCan’s 10th anniversary performance. That experience gave me trust and responsibility.

## Ananya and Growth

An alumni meet introduced Ananya, a cultural and sports event for the children. Organizing Ananya taught management, fundraising, team coordination, and stakeholder collaboration (Rotary Club, NGOs, alumni). Club politics surfaced—initially constructive, later divisive around funds—leading me to step down, but the experience and friendships remained invaluable.

## Technical Awakening

In the second year, I joined e-Yantra (IIT Bombay) and chose an ML-heavy problem. That opened doors to ANARC (robotics club) where, after initial rejection, I became AI/ML lead. This marked the start of a deeper focus on data science and machine learning.

## Founding DSAI

I helped found DSAI (Data Science & AI club). With minimal Python background, I led projects, speaker sessions, and workshops. Early projects included Emotional Facial Recognition, Cursor Control using IRIS, and Flight Sky Saver (cheapest flight routes). Within a year, I was recognized on campus for data science work; DSAI became a stable presence in the college technical ecosystem.

## Research Dreams: IIT Roorkee

Seeking research, I contacted professors and was recommended to an Emeritus Professor at IIT Roorkee. Her high standards pushed me to read deeply (notably Aurélien Géron’s Hands-On Machine Learning). My research idea—AI detection of diseases from eye images—remains a long-term goal. During a vaccine side-effects study, I used campus networks to scale data collection from 150 to 542 responses, performed exhaustive analysis, and co-authored a paper by the end of the second year.

## The Placement Saga

Third year brought selective opportunities (Amazon ML Summer School, Goldman Sachs screening) and many rejections. Interview lapses, frozen systems, and timing clashes caused setbacks. The week of 6–11 October was particularly brutal: multiple overlapping interviews, proctoring failures, and several near-misses. After emotional lows, I reframed setbacks as preparation for something bigger.

## The Dream Realized

As TNP coordinator for ACT-fibernet, I juggled event duties and interviews. Despite exhaustion, I topped the GD shortlist and cleared multiple technical rounds. The CIO interview raised expectations and uncertainty about an immediate AI/ML role, but I emphasized eagerness to learn in any role. Final confirmation arrived at 12:30 AM on 11th October—my parents’ 25th wedding anniversary—a moment I chose to share the next morning as a special gift.

## Reflections — Key Lessons

- Start practical: learn Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib before advanced topics.  
- Pass knowledge forward: mentor juniors rather than using clubs only for resumes.  
- Explore everything: clubs, events, and politics build leadership and resilience.  
- Trust destiny: rejections often prepare you for better opportunities.  
- Infrastructure matters: colleges must ensure reliable systems, mock interviews, and placement prep.  
- Build connections: maintain ties between juniors, seniors, and alumni to keep pipelines open.

## My Dreams Ahead

- Make my parents proud.  
- Work in algorithmic trading or start a trading startup.  
- Complete the AI-based eye-disease detection project to improve healthcare access.

## Final Message

The journey—from not knowing the difference between IIT and ITI to getting placed at a top company—was built on persistence, learning from failure, and trusting the process. Every setback and leadership role shaped skills that matter today. Your story is still being written; keep growing, keep learning, and trust that destiny prepares what you need next.
